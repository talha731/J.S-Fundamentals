This repo is about the Javascript fundamentals that I learned in the past week, This challange is about a webpage that uses Javascript to do a financial analysis on the values provided in the starter code. The html code is given in the starter code to make the page work but the real magic is in the inspect element -> console which is ammended by javascript. 

My motivation for this project is to make sure the I have learned the stuff taugh in the lessons. To make this project a stepping stone on my journy to a frontend development. I build this project because I wanted to test what the knowledge that I gained from the bootcamp and apply it to a real world example.

It solves problems of financial analysis that was provided to me by the starter code.

I learned how to use different attritibutes of Javascript like arrays, console.log etc.

An image of the page is attached at the end
